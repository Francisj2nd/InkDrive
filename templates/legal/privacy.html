            <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We work with third-party service providers to help us operate our Service (e.g., hosting, data storage, AI model providers). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>With AI Model Providers (Google AI):</strong> The inputs you provide to our AI tools are sent to Google's AI models to generate content. We do not allow third parties to use your data to train their models.</li>

            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement robust security measures to protect your information, including:</p>
            <ul>
